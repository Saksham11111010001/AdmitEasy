## ðŸ’¡ Inspiration:
The inspiration behind our Post-Secondary Admission Website was to help high school students transition to post-secondary education smoothly.
We understand the challenges and anxiety that come with the process of applying to post-secondary schools, and we wanted to create a platform to guide and support students throughout the entire application process.

## ðŸ¤– What it does:
Our website has multiple pages, including a home page, a chatbot feature, and essay and resume review pages.
Our chatbot feature allows students to connect with an AI personal advisor to receive guidance and support for their post-secondary education.
Our essay and resume review pages provide expert feedback to students to help them create a compelling application that stands out from the rest.

## ðŸ§  How we built it:
Our team of four contributors developed the website using html and w3.css, a lightweight and responsive CSS framework.
We used Node.js for the backend.

## ðŸ˜Ž Accomplishments that we're proud of:
We're proud of creating a deployable website that helps high school students achieve their goals and pursue their passions.

## ðŸ¥¸ What we learned:
Through the development of our website, we learned the importance of creating a user-friendly and accessible platform for students.
We also learned the significance of providing personalized guidance and support to students, as every student's journey to post-secondary education is unique.

## ðŸ¥³ What's next for Post-Secondary Admission Website:
In the future, we plan to expand our services to include more post-secondary schools and offer additional features to further support students in their post-secondary journey.
We also plan to enhance our AI personal advisor feature to provide more accurate and personalized advice to students.
